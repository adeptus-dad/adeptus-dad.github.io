After a few coats of paint, the result is not so bad. Behold the Zebulon-pattern Dropship!    \t      \t  This class of dropship was frequently used before the Heresy by Legio Gregoros to deploy pairs of Proteus pattern Warhound titans behind ennemy lines (or on the laundry room’s countertop).    \t      \t      \t      \t  If you want one (or more) I offer some pre-cut kits on Gumroad.

This way I can build a nice maniple with one Reaver and four warhounds, while starting some small games against the other Reaver + the Cerastii (Cerastuses?)    \t  But at the moment, I have partially re-painted my Proteus Warhounds with a less flashy and more mottled green (a la Legio Solaria), and made some good use of the cheap k40 chinese laser-cutter that we have bought last Christmas. I designed 8mm-scale terrain in 3mm MDF!I tried to balance the level of detail with the engraving and cut time.

There are a couple of millimeter adjustments to make to the body (more thickness where it broke, and make the head protrude by 1.5mm).

For a long time, I’ve wanted to convert stantard shooty boyz to tankbustas simply by adding a missile to the front of their shoota. The reasoning being that firing a bullet in a missile was a very good way to launch it.I was just needing some propa’ orky missiles, so I went to OpenScad. And of course, the beauty of OpenScad is that your 3D models can be parametric. So, if you have a parametric missile model and some random values, you can generate any number of different missiles. The parameters I choose were:  radius of the missile  length of the warhead  length of the body  size of the fins  number of finsSource code is on Github. Feel free to reuse/modify it! I’ll post the result as I receive I have received my order from Shapeways, and it’s great!I set up a store on Shapeways if you want to order this directly. (I added a 3€ markup to the Shapeways price, if I sell a few of these I will be able to fund some new project).",

The order is made on Shapeways, we’ll see in a few weeks if it all fits.You can see below a few beauty shots of the various parts. I think that I found a way to mount the plasma cannon sideways, I will leave the flamer for a later iteration (maybe with the Trident/Ursus Claw that I have had in mind for several weeks…)The arms are designed to be magnetized. The shoulder sphere can receive a ∅3mm x 4mm magnet, and I plan to put a simple piece of metal inside the body. I hope that this way I can avoid polarity mistakes with the magnets and allow for easier posability of the arms (two magnets tend to align their axes, while I want a ball joint).",

So to keep in line with what GW has been doing with the Land Speeder, Land Raider, Missile Launcher, etc. let’s call the old (superior) design Proteus Pattern. So, I have these sitting on my desk and I must admit that I really don’t like this Mars Pattern body, it’s not very elegant (don’t start me on the Lucius Patterns!) So, the obvious solution is to whip out OpenScad and start modelling replacement bodies for my new plastic warhounds!After a few hours, things are beginning to take shape…Still a lot of adjustments to do: rivets (lots), various details, exhaust vents, etc. The arm is intended to mount the laser blasters and vulcan mega bolters sideways, to keep the old approach. I don’t think that the plasma and flamer weapons would work visually sideways. Different mounting arms will be needed. The whole thing is designed so that the weapons can be magnetized, and hopefully, the weapon cabling will get under the carapace.This is a work in progress, hopefully I will get the final design soon, and then… off to Shapeways!",

This was a specialized very heavy weapon, and therefore reserved to Warlord-class titans (I don’t think Reavers could take this).In 2012, Aaron Dembski-Bowden wrote a fine book named Betrayer (the 24th novel in the Horus Heresy Series) featuring the Warhound-only Legio Audax (Ember Wolves) which intensively used a very similar weapon design. These Ursus Claws allow the light titans to take literally down larger ones by using pack tactics and toppling big guys. The same kind of weapin were used on imperial navy ships for boarding assaults.Of course, some talented people started building them for the ForgeWorld resin titans.Poom made himself an Ursus Claw for his chaos warhound titan.Also, on the blog of the excellent Aaron Dembski-Bowden, I found Benjamin Sephton-Smith’s Warhound with an ursus claw armament on his Morning Star Warhound.More recently, the concept was transferred to knight, with the thundercoil harpoon available to Knight Valiants.",
