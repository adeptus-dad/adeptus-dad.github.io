The chain was a bit tricky, but the result is not so bad (considering my painting).I have designed a version that shoul work with the Mars pattern warhound kit. I have NOT test-printed it, you can see it below, compared to the proteus patern.    \t      \t  And finally, I have printed an arm that allows to mount the inferno cannon on the proteus pattern warhounds (or any other horizontal weapon).    \t      \t  If you want them, you will have to wait until I upload the files there:  \t  Shapeways    \t  cgtrader  ",

After a few modifications, I have made the designs available for purchase. On Shapeways if you want to order them printed, and cgtrader if you want the STLs to try and print them yourself (I would be glad to hear of your experience).I will soon begin to work on an arm that allows to mount the inferno cannon in the horizontal position, as well as an ursus claw. I don’t even own the rules for Adeptus Titanicus, so I will not be able to write custom rule for the ursus…Bye!",

They will send me a replacement part that will go on doggie number two. I tested everything, and… it fits very well!The carapace and arms mount work exactly as intended. There are a couple of millimeter adjustments to make to the body (more thickness where it broke, and make the head protrude by 1.5mm). Oh, in my previous posts I forgot to mention the new barrels for the Vulcan. Now, that’s a proper MEGA bolter.The weapons were magnetized via ∅3mm x 4mm magnets, and I superglued two nuts inside the body, it works very well.I will try to put some paint on it soon!",

        "content": "My recent order to Shapeways was the occasion to try something I whipped up a while ago: parametric ork missiles! For a long time, I’ve wanted to convert stantard shooty boyz to tankbustas simply by adding a missile to the front of their shoota. The reasoning being that firing a bullet in a missile was a very good way to launch it.I was just needing some propa’ orky missiles, so I went to OpenScad. And of course, the beauty of OpenScad is that your 3D models can be parametric. So, if you have a parametric missile model and some random values, you can generate any number of different missiles. The parameters I choose were:  radius of the missile  length of the warhead  length of the body  size of the fins  number of finsSource code is on Github. Feel free to reuse/modify it! I’ll post the result as I receive I have received my order from Shapeways, and it’s great!I set up a store on Shapeways if you want to order this directly. (I added a 3€ markup to the Shapeways price, if I sell a few of these I will be able to fund some new project).",

        "content": "With the positive reactions after yeasterday’s post on r/adeptustitanicus and r/3Dprintedtabletops, I was encouraged to finish the alpha design of the Proteus Pattern Warhound Titan’s replacement parts. The order is made on Shapeways, we’ll see in a few weeks if it all fits.You can see below a few beauty shots of the various parts. I think that I found a way to mount the plasma cannon sideways, I will leave the flamer for a later iteration (maybe with the Trident/Ursus Claw that I have had in mind for several weeks…)The arms are designed to be magnetized. The shoulder sphere can receive a ∅3mm x 4mm magnet, and I plan to put a simple piece of metal inside the body. I hope that this way I can avoid polarity mistakes with the magnets and allow for easier posability of the arms (two magnets tend to align their axes, while I want a ball joint).",

        "content": "I’ve heard they call the “new” Warhound design Mars Pattern. So to keep in line with what GW has been doing with the Land Speeder, Land Raider, Missile Launcher, etc. let’s call the old (superior) design Proteus Pattern. So, I have these sitting on my desk and I must admit that I really don’t like this Mars Pattern body, it’s not very elegant (don’t start me on the Lucius Patterns!) So, the obvious solution is to whip out OpenScad and start modelling replacement bodies for my new plastic warhounds!After a few hours, things are beginning to take shape…Still a lot of adjustments to do: rivets (lots), various details, exhaust vents, etc. The arm is intended to mount the laser blasters and vulcan mega bolters sideways, to keep the old approach. I don’t think that the plasma and flamer weapons would work visually sideways. Different mounting arms will be needed. The whole thing is designed so that the weapons can be magnetized, and hopefully, the weapon cabling will get under the carapace.This is a work in progress, hopefully I will get the final design soon, and then… off to Shapeways!",

        "content": "Once upon a time in 1991, the original Adeptus Titanicus game was all the rage, and new weapons’ rules were published in White Dwarf 133. Among these new weapons, was the Trident. This was a specialized very heavy weapon, and therefore reserved to Warlord-class titans (I don’t think Reavers could take this).In 2012, Aaron Dembski-Bowden wrote a fine book named Betrayer (the 24th novel in the Horus Heresy Series) featuring the Warhound-only Legio Audax (Ember Wolves) which intensively used a very similar weapon design. These Ursus Claws allow the light titans to take literally down larger ones by using pack tactics and toppling big guys. The same kind of weapin were used on imperial navy ships for boarding assaults.Of course, some talented people started building them for the ForgeWorld resin titans.Poom made himself an Ursus Claw for his chaos warhound titan.Also, on the blog of the excellent Aaron Dembski-Bowden, I found Benjamin Sephton-Smith’s Warhound with an ursus claw armament on his Morning Star Warhound.More recently, the concept was transferred to knight, with the thundercoil harpoon available to Knight Valiants.",
