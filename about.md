I have been collecting, painting and playing a lot of Games Workshop stuff between the mid-eighties and the end of the 20th century. In 2018, I have unearthed most of my old stuff to show to my 11 yo daughter and 9 yo son. They seemed to like it. We've since been playing games of Adeptus Titanicus and Warhammer 40k with simplified rules.

This website serves as a hobby blog, rules repository and will perhaps host some batrep. Rules will be written in French (we speak that here), but if someone shows some interest, I will be humbled and may write english versions.

This website is using Centrarium, a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. Adeptus Dad likes it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository][centrarium].
