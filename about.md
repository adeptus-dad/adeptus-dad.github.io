I have been collecting, painting and playing a lot of Games Workshop stuff between the mid-eighties and the end of the 20th century. In 2018, I have unearthed most of my old stuff to show to my 11 yo daughter and 9 yo son. They seemed to like it. We've since been playing games of Adeptus Titanicus and Warhammer 40k with simplified rules.

This website serves as a hobby blog, rules repository and will perhaps host some batrep. Rules will be written in French (we speak that here), but if someone shows some interest, I would be quite pleased and may write english versions.
