I have been collecting, painting and playing a lot of Games Workshop stuff between the mid-eighties and the end of the 20th century. In 2018, I have unearthed most of my old stuff to show to my 11 yo daughter and 9 yo son. They seemed to like it. We've since been playing games of Adeptus Titanicus and Warhammer 40k with simplified rules.

This website serves as a hobby blog, will perhaps host some batrep. I have begun to sell some 3D models that I designed for myself and also some laser cutting plans. It is far from making me rich, but helps in funding the hobby and justifying the time investment in new projects. Thanks to you all!
