As a small experiment, I tried to build a Super-Heavy Tank at 8mm scale (whatever that means) with my k40 laser cutter and 3mm MDF. After a coat of paint the result is not so bad, and absolutely cheap if you already have the cutter.

I still have to whip up some rules (no shields, limited movement, macro-cannon?) and try them in a small game. The one on the picture is the prototype, I have made small adjustments to the plans since. Speaking of the plans: you will find them below (.SVG originally tested with k40whisperer). You just have to add a cannon barrel, I made mine in plasticard with three diameters. Out of a set from [Greenstuffworld][greenstuffworld] (I get no money from them, but they're nice).
