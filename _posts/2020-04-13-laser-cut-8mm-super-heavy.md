As a small experiment, I tried to build a Super-Heavy Tank at 8mm scale (whatever that means) with my k40 laser cutter and 3mm MDF. After a coat of paint the result is not so bad, and absolutely cheap if you already have the cutter.

I still have to whip up some rules (no shields, limited movement, macro-cannon?) and try them in a small game. The one on the picture is the prototype, I have adjuted the plans since. Speakinf of the plans: here they are (tested with k40whisperer).
