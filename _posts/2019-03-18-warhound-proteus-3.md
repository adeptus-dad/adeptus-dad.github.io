I received my order from Shapeways! The body was a bit damaged, but I was able to salvage it with greenstuff. They will send me a replacement part that will go on doggie number two. I tested everything, and... it fits very well!

The carapace and arms mount work exactly as intended. There are a couple of millimeter adjustments to make to the body (more thickness where it broke, and make the head protrude by 1.5mm). Oh, in my previous posts I forgot to mention the new barrels for the Vulcan. Now, that's a proper **MEGA** bolter.

The weapons were magnetized via âˆ…3mm x 4mm magnets, and I superglued two nuts inside the body, it works very well.

I will try to put some paint on it soon!
