After reading the excellent [Titandeath][td] by Guy Haley a few months ago, I began to think about dropships and how they could be incorporated at the AT18 scale. I decided to try my hand at a smallish dropship designed to deploy a pair of Warhound titans. I quickly put aside the thought of using 3d printing due to the size/cost, so went with laser cut mdf. After a few coats of paint, the result is not so bad. Behold the Zebulon-pattern Dropship!

  </div>

This class of dropship was frequently used before the Heresy by Legio Gregoros to deploy pairs of Proteus pattern Warhound titans behind ennemy lines (or on the laundry room's countertop).

If you want one (or more) I offer some pre-cut kits on Gumroad. This is the first time I try selling physical goods, I will ship ony in Europe for now. I can also offer the SVG files in the case you own a laser cutter, if you are interested, please contact me directly.
