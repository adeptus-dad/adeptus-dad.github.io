Things will get a bit livelier around here, as **Adeptus Son** has decided to join the internet party as acting social media overseer. We may observe some activity in the coming days and weeks.

On another front, CGtrader has changed their payout rate system starting June 2nd. This would lower us to about 61%, which a bit of a scam, I think. We will soon delete our CGtrader account and focus on Cults. We will update our old posts with the correct store links.
