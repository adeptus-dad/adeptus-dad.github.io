![missiles][missiles]
My [recent order][proteus] to Shapeways was the occasion to try something I whipped up a while ago: parametric ork missiles! For a long time, I've wanted to convert stantard shooty boyz to tankbustas simply by adding a missile to the front of their shoota. The reasoning being that firing a bullet in a missile was a very good way to launch it.

I was just needing some propa' orky missiles, so I went to OpenScad. And of course, the beauty of OpenScad is that your 3D models can be *parametric*. So, if you have a parametric missile model and some random values, you can generate any number of different missiles. The parameters I choose were:
- radius of the missile
- length of the warhead
- length of the body
- size of the fins
- number of fins

S	ource code is on [Github][github]. Feel free to reuse/modify it! ~~I'll post the result as I receive~~ I have received my order from Shapeways, and it's great!

I set up a store on Shapeways if you want to order this directly. (I added a 3â‚¬ markup to the Shapeways price, if I sell a few of these I will be able to fund some new project).
