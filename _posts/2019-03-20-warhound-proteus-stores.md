First of all, I would like to thank everyone on [r/adeptustitanicus][reddit] for the support and kind words. I'm happy with the results so far, and after a few modifications, I have made the designs available for purchase on [Shapeways][shapeways] if you want to order them printed, and [cgtrader][cgtrader] if you want the STLs to try and print them yourself (I would be glad to hear of your experience).

I will soon begin to work on an arm that allows to mount the inferno cannon in the horizontal position, as well as an ursus claw. I don't even own the rules for Adeptus Titanicus, so I will not be able to write custom rule for the ursus...

Bye!
