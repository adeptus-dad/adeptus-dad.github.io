With the positive reactions after yeasterday's post on [r/adeptustitanicus](https://www.reddit.com/r/adeptustitanicus/comments/aye7z3/proteus_pattern_warhound_titan_in_openscad/) and [r/3Dprintedtabletops](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprintedtabletops/), I was encouraged to finish the alpha design of the Proteus Pattern Warhound Titan's replacement parts. The order is made on Shapeways, we'll see in a few weeks if it all fits. 

You can see below a few beauty shots of the various parts. I think that I found a way to mount the plasma cannon sideways, I will leave the flamer for a later iteration (maybe with the Trident/Ursus Claw that I have had in mind for several weeks...)

The arms are designed to be magnetized. The shoulder sphere can receive a âˆ…3mm x 4mm magnet, and I plan to put a simple piece of metal inside the body. I hope that this way I can avoid polarity mistakes with the magnets and allow for easier posability of the arms (two magnets tend to align their axes, while I want a ball joint).
